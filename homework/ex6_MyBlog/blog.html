        Firstly, to improve the performance efficiency and the Memory utilization.Process concurrency and resource
        sharing can make the computer work more efficient. Sequential execution is ineffective so that waste a lot of
        time.But now, at the waiting stage, the CPU can choose to deal with other process(scheduler dispatch).

        Process is the basic unit of resource allocation and scheduling. We can abstract the process of running
        programs, clearly see the dynamic system.

        For the reason to divided the process into five stage, I think that new, ready, running, waiting, terminated are
        the basic stages of a process. There may be other stage that is not so important.

        This five stages consists the life cycle of a process, which depicts the entire
        process. Process status that reflects the state of a process.

        Symbian was a mobile operating system (OS) and computing platform designed for smartphones.[6] Symbian was
        originally developed as a closed-source OS for PDAsin 1998 by Symbian Ltd.[7] Symbian OS was a descendant
        of Psion's EPOC, and runs exclusively on ARM processors, although an unreleased x86 port existed. Symbian was
        used by many major mobile phone brands, like Samsung, Motorola, Sony Ericsson, and above all by Nokia. It was
        also prevalent in Japan by brands including Fujitsu, Sharp and Mitsubishi. As a pioneer that established the
        smartphone industry, it was the most popular smartphone OS on a worldwide average until the end of 2010 – at a
        time when smartphones were in limited use, when it was overtaken by Android, as Google and its partners achieved
        wide adoption.
