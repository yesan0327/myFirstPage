    jvvkvkvk<span>Firstly,</span> to improve the performance efficiency and the Memory utilization.Process concurrency
    and resource sharing can make the computer work more efficient. Sequential execution is ineffective so that waste a
    lot of time.But now, at the waiting stage, the CPU can choose to deal with other process(scheduler dispatch).

    Process is the basic unit of resource allocation and scheduling. We can abstract the process of running programs,
    clearly see the dynamic system.

    For the reason to divided the process into five stage, I think that new, ready, running, waiting, terminated are the
    basic stages of a process. There may be other stage that is not so important.

    This five stages consists the life cycle of a process, which depicts the entire
    process. Process status that reflects the state of a process.
